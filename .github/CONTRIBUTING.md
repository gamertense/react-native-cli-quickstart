# React Native CLI Quickstart

[![e2e-ios](https://github.com/remarkablemark/react-native-cli-quickstart/actions/workflows/e2e-ios.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/remarkablemark/react-native-cli-quickstart/actions/workflows/e2e-ios.yml)

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli):

```sh
npx @react-native-community/cli init ReactNativeCLIQuickstart
```

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Install

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/remarkablemark/react-native-cli-quickstart.git
cd react-native-cli-quickstart
```

Install the Node.js dependencies:

```sh
yarn
```

Install the Pod dependencies:

```sh
bundle exec pod install --project-directory=ios
```

## Quickstart

Start the application:

```sh
yarn start
```

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```sh
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```sh
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```sh
yarn ios
```

Or open `./ios/ReactNativeCLIQuickstart.xcworkspace` in Xcode and hit the **Run** button:

```sh
xed -b ios
```

See [Get Started with macOS](https://aka.ms/ReactNativeGuideMacOS) for the latest up-to-date instructions.

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

   To close and reopen the app, go to menu > **Simulator** > **Device** > **App Switcher**.

### Debug

Press <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> in the simulator or **Shake** your device to open the React Native debug menu.

You can also [access the in-app developer menu](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging) with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd>.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
